# employee-directory
For this project, we have created an employee table with React to store, filter, and sort employees in a company. The user is presented with a able of all their employees. When the user types in the search bar, they are presented with all employee names that match the input criteria. When they click the the sort buttons, the employees will rearrange according to their name.

## Why
For employers, it can come in handy to keep track of employee information and be able to access it quickly. Find the information you need without flipping through contact books or business cards.


## The Process
First thing I did was create the React app with create-react-app then connecting it to a Github Repo. Then I set up all the folders and files necessary and deleted the unneeded ones. After that, I set up my array of employees. With those in place, I could write out the properties that each employee will have visiable in Item.jsx. Linking that to List.jsx, I added the column headers and then looped over the array to display all employees. With the whole array displayed, I added the search bar and gave it functionality. Then I worked on adding the sorting buttons. Future development will focus on dynamic employee input, fluid reloading of the array filtering, getting the sort buttons to actually work and giving more sorting options, and more CSS styling.
